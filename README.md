# Legacy Jam 2026 — Website

A simple, accessible, single-page website for **Legacy Jam** (October 23–25, 2026, Toronto).
No build step — just `index.html` + `style.css` + `assets/`. The only JavaScript is a
~10-line progressive enhancement that shows/hides the back-to-top button; the button's
`href="#top"` link works with plain CSS scrolling even if it never runs.

**Design:** gold-on-navy palette pulled from the Legacy Jam logo set (deep navy `#0c111c`,
cream `#f4e9cf`, gold `#e4c73d`, maroon `#64251e`), with a script typeface (Yellowtail) echoing
the brand wordmark, gold-gradient headings, subtle film grain, hairline gold rules echoing the
"— JAM —" mark, and a timeline-styled schedule. All decorative; content order and reading
clarity come first, and `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the entrance animation.

## How to publish

Easiest option — GitHub Pages:

1. Merge this branch to `main`.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` / root**.
3. The site goes live at `https://<username>.github.io/legacyjam/`.

Or drag the folder into Netlify / Vercel, or upload to any web host.

## ✅ Replace-before-launch checklist

These placeholders are marked with `TODO` comments in `index.html`:

| Placeholder | Where | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| ~~`https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/legacy-jam-2026`~~ | every "Get Tickets" button | ✅ done — links to `https://legacyjam2026.eventbrite.ca` |
| `https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/REPLACE-ME-WORKSHOPS` | "Get Workshop Tickets" button, `#tickets` section | create a separate Eventbrite event for Sunday workshops and link it here |
| ~~`https://forms.gle/REPLACE-ME`~~ | "Register to Battle" buttons | ✅ done — links to `https://breakkonnect.com/event/4898` |
| ~~`https://forms.gle/REPLACE-ME-PARTNER`~~ | "Become a Generations Partner" button | ✅ done — links to `generations-partner.html` |
| ~~`https://www.instagram.com/legacyjam`~~ | hero, artists, schedule, footer | ✅ done — confirmed handle `@legacy.jam` |
| `info@legacyjam.com` | travel, footer, volunteer button | confirmed email address |
| ~~`assets/legacy-jam-logo.svg`~~ | header, hero, footer | ✅ done — official logo (vector, transparent background) |
| Crew bio + milestones | `#about` section | ✅ done — real bios/milestones from confirmed source copy |
| Artist Instagram handles | `#artists` section | verify every handle — several are best guesses (djbbad, djtimber, switchb, deadlymike, bgirltiff, bboymadtrack, bboystripes, mgbility, boobjester) |
| Legacy Party venue address | `#schedule` section (Sat, Oct 24 card) | confirmed venue name/address — site currently says only "a separate event at a different venue" |

### Logos

All partner and funder logos are real files in `assets/logos/` — nothing left to swap.
To add a new partner: drop the logo file in `assets/logos/` and add an `<li>` to the
matching `logo-row` list in `index.html`.

### Volunteer, Media Pass & Generations Partner applications

"Apply to volunteer for Legacy Jam" and "Become a Generations Partner" are
built-in application forms (`volunteer.html`, `generations-partner.html`)
that submit via [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) to info@legacyjam.com,
no backend required. "Request a Media Pass" is a plain `mailto:` link.

**Important — activate FormSubmit before launch:** the very first submission
to `formsubmit.co/info@legacyjam.com` triggers a one-time confirmation email
that must be clicked before FormSubmit will deliver any submissions. Until
that's confirmed, submissions are silently accepted but never arrive — send
a test submission through each form and confirm the activation email lands
(check spam) before relying on these forms for real applications.

## 📋 Internal production notes (keep off the public site)

- [ ] Check if **Mad Track** is still available Oct 24
- [ ] Look into Exchanges opponents — **Stripes? Luigi?**
- [ ] Confirm airport shuttle logistics for Generations Partners (now the only guests offered a pre-booked shuttle) + who monitors the info@legacyjam.com inbox
- [ ] Confirm Eventbrite ticket tiers match: $20 competitors / $25 audience / $5 kids under 10 / $25 each workshop (or $50 for 3) / $70 full festival pass
- [ ] **Activate FormSubmit for info@legacyjam.com** — click the one-time confirmation link (see note above) or submissions will keep going nowhere
- [x] Set up the Generations Partner sign-up form (school registration, promo code, VIP meet & greet) — later replaced with a mailto: link, see note above
