# Legacy Jam — Content & Prompt Kit

Copy blocks and reusable prompts for building out the Legacy Jam website, socials and
Eventbrite listing. Everything here matches the live copy in `index.html` — edit in both
places if you change the message.

---

## 1. Core messaging

**Event name:** Legacy Jam 2026
**Tagline:** Cyphers / Culture / Community
**Dates:** October 23–25, 2026 · Toronto
**One-liner:** A three-day breaking festival connecting generations — battles, cyphers, workshops, talks and the after party.

**Purpose statement (short):**
> Breaking is rooted in cyphers, community and culture — passed down generation to
> generation. Legacy Jam keeps that chain alive: celebrating the people who built
> Canadian breaking, investing in the youth who'll carry it forward, and putting
> Canadian breakers on the world stage.

**Elevator pitch (for Eventbrite / press):**
> Legacy Jam is Toronto's intergenerational breaking festival. Over three days, teachers
> battle beside their students, youth winners earn flights to Outbreak Europe 2027, and
> Canadian breakers face international guests in curated Legacy Exchanges — plus workshops,
> talks, and a party that brings the whole community together.

## 2. Battle formats (canonical descriptions)

Site section is titled "Battles and Prizes". Each card leads with a one-line
format/age description, then **Prize &rarr; Register link.** Prize is the
visual highlight of each card (bold, on a tinted background band); round
counts and the "purpose" line are intentionally left out of the public copy
to keep each card to a couple of lines. Generations Battle uses a plain-language
description instead of the Format/Age label pair, since "teacher and student
battle side by side" reads clearer than "2v2 / 10+ yr gap" for that format.

- **Generations Battle** — Teacher and student battle side by side (minimum
  10-year age gap per duo).
  *Prize: $2,500 cash: $1,200 winner · $500 second · $200 top 4 · $100 top 8.*
- **Youth Cypher Battle** — Format: 1v1. Age: Under 19.
  *Prize: Youth is the Future Camp entry + flight to Outbreak Europe, July 2027
  (flight, accommodation &amp; entry all covered, Slovakia). Site copy shows
  both the Outbreak Europe and Youth is the Future Camp logos side by side
  next to this prize.*
- **Pro Cypher Battle** — Format: 1v1. Age: 19+.
  *Prize: flight to Outbreak Europe, July 2027 (trip, entry &amp; accommodation,
  Slovakia).*

Legacy Exchanges is a showcase, not a competitive battle format, it lives in "The Festival"
copy, not the Battles section: *Curated battle conversations, Canadian breakers vs
international guests, built to inspire across generations.*

## 3. Ticket packages

*Competitors and Audience are door prices (walk-up, day-of); Workshops and the
Full Festival Pass are advance, Eventbrite-only prices. Early bird tickets
(no "super early bird" tier — just early bird) are on Eventbrite now, in
limited quantities for a limited time — site copy calls this out with a
"Limited time" badge in the tickets section lede, again as a bold
gold-highlighted line under the ticket list ("⏳ Early bird tickets are
limited and going fast — get yours on Eventbrite now."), once more in the
closing CTA section ("Early bird tickets are limited and going fast — grab
yours on Eventbrite now and claim your battle spot."), and now also as a small
"Early Bird" badge directly on every "Get Tickets" button site-wide (header,
hero, tickets section, schedule section, closing CTA).*

Site shows these as a single compact list (`.ticket-list`), not individual
cards with their own buttons, one "Get Tickets" button at the bottom links to
Eventbrite for everything (except Workshops, see below).

| Package | Price | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| Competitors | $20, door price | Battle Day entry for competitors |
| Audience | $25, door price | Battle Day entry for spectators |
| Kids (under 10) | $5, door price | Battle Day entry for kids under 10 |
| Workshops | $20 each | Separate ticket. Book 1–2, or 2 for $30 |
| **Full Festival Pass** | **$40** | both workshops + Battle Day (also includes Legacy Party & Sunday's panels) |

Site copy spells out the Full Pass contents in the ticket row itself ("both
workshops + Battle Day") and again in full below the list: "Full Festival
Pass includes both workshops and a ticket to Battle Day — plus the Legacy
Party and Sunday's panels."

**Workshops are on a separate Eventbrite page from the main Festival
ticket** — only the Full Festival Pass includes them on the main ticket.
Below the main ticket list/button, a dedicated "Sunday Workshops" callout
(`.workshop-callout`) makes this explicit: its own heading with a "Separate
ticket" badge, a short explainer ("Sunday starts free: cyphers & 2 panels,
10 AM–1:30 PM. Workshops need their own ticket, unless you have the Full
Festival Pass."), and the venue (Unity Studio, 1560 Yonge St Suite 204,
Toronto, wheelchair accessible).

Below the venue line, the callout now also lists the two free panel
discussions (11 AM–12 PM Panel: Mentorship, 12–1 PM Panel: Breaking careers
& parallel careers) with a "Register for Panels (Free)" button (placeholder
Eventbrite URL until a free registration page exists, see README checklist).

Then the two workshop time slots (1:30–3:00 PM Workshop 1: Creativity —
Ronnie, 3:00–4:30 PM Workshop 2: From Foundation to Style — Puzzles, each
1.5 hr), the $20-each/$30-for-2 price, and its own "Get Workshop Tickets"
button linking to the separate workshops Eventbrite page (placeholder URL
until that page exists, see README checklist).

## 4. Reusable prompts

## 5. Schedule (canonical)

Site displays a "⏱️ Battles run on time — don't be late!" callout right under the
Schedule heading, above the day grid, followed by a short "Times may change —
check back for updates" hint.

**Fri Oct 23 — Welcome Jam** · Collective, 389 Spadina Ave, Toronto · 5–10 PM
Free, no registration required — just show up. Kids under 14 must be
accompanied by a guardian at all times (site copy states both of these right
at the top of the Friday card, above the schedule list). Cyphers, graffiti
workshop, music and good vibes. No competitive battles, just a low-key
kickoff to meet people before Battle Day.

**Sat Oct 24 — Battle Day** · 918 Bathurst St (not wheelchair accessible) · 12–7:30 PM
12:00 arrive/register/cyphers → 1:00 Generations prelims (1 rd) → 2:30 Pro & Youth cypher
prelims (2 circles) → 3:30 Exhibitions 1 & 2 → 4:00 Generations top 16 (1 rd)
→ 4:30 Pro & Youth top 8 (2 rds) → 5:00 Generations top 8 (1 rd) → 5:30 Exhibition 3 →
5:45 Pro & Youth top 4 (3 rds) → 6:15 Generations top 4 (2 rds) → 6:30 Pro & Youth finals
(5 rds) → 6:45 OG Cypher (20 min) → 7:00 Generations final (2 rds) → 7:30 awards

**Children's Hip Hop Zone** — 1:00–6:00 PM, basement, 918 Bathurst St, ages 5–11.
Beginner moves, breaker-name & art name tag making, art stations, a hip hop
scavenger hunt & a mini kids' cypher. Parents must accompany their children at
all times.

**Legacy Party (19+)** — 9:00 PM, separate event, different venue (TODO: confirm
address before launch). Called out on the site as its own thing, not part of the
Battle Day timeline/venue.

*Flow rationale: youth battles finish early so families can leave before evening; the Pro
final closes the day at peak energy; Exchanges are spread out as palate-cleansers between
tournament rounds.*

**Sun Oct 25 — Workshops & Panels** · Unity Studio, 1560 Yonge St Suite 204 (wheelchair accessible) · 10 AM–4:30 PM
Free block, 10 AM–1:30 PM: 10:00–11:00 cyphers (community) → 11:00–12:00 Panel Discussion:
Mentorship ("Why mentorship matters to breaking's next generation.") → 12:00–1:00 Panel
Discussion: Breaking careers & parallel careers ("Building a career in and beyond
breaking.") → 1:00–1:30 more cyphers (community). Both panels are a full hour each and
list "Panelists to be announced soon." until confirmed; cyphers bookend the panels at the
start and end of the free block.
Paid workshops, 1:30–4:30 PM: 1:30–3:00 Workshop 1: Creativity, taught by Ronnie (Full Force,
SuperCr3w, 7 Commandoz, SuperWockeez, District Arts) → 3:00–4:30 Workshop 2: From Foundation
to Style, taught by Puzzles (Supernaturalz, Nooma Space Academy). Each workshop is 1.5 hr,
with the theme in the slot title and instructor credit shown as a `.sched-desc` sub-line
underneath (matching the panel sub-line pattern). $20 each workshop, or 2 for $30.

*Cyphers and both panels are free and open to everyone; only the 2 workshops require a
ticket. Site copy calls out "(free)" next to each Sunday-morning schedule item and adds a
note under the list: "Cyphers & panels (10 AM–1:30 PM) are free. Workshops: $20 each, or 2
for $30." Same pricing repeated in the Tickets & Passes section (both the Workshops row
hint "or 2 for $30" and the paragraph below the ticket list). Each panel gets a short 6–8
word one-line description under its title (`.sched-desc`), plus a "Panelists to be
announced soon" placeholder — replace once panelists are confirmed.*

## 6. Crew & volunteering

**MEC Crew bio (short):**
> MEC Crew is breakers, DJs and organizers working for and with the community —
> decades on the floor between them, battling, judging, teaching and building
> events. Breaking, DJing, hosting, teaching, visual art: they live the elements,
> and still show up for the cypher for the love of hip hop culture, breaking and
> building future generations.

**Organizing team (on the site, collapsed behind a "Meet the organizing team"
`<details>` dropdown so the About section stays short by default, one paragraph
per person). Pulled from the Canada Council / OAC grant crew bios source doc for
accuracy, condensed to 3–4 sentences each:**

- **Piecez** (Michael Prosserman): breaking since 1999, judged battles and taught
  workshops across Canada, Europe and Asia (Canadian Arctic to Japan and Hong
  Kong). 26 international competition wins; certified Breaking Judge and Head

  into calligraphy and visual art. Still active as a judge/panelist/mentor
  (Yukon Cypher Fest, etc.). Visual art practice spans New York, Miami, Zurich,
  Barcelona, Los Angeles, with clients including Bloomingdale's, Porsche and
  Samsung.

*Full source bios (much more detail available — judged events, discography, awards,
exhibitions) are on file; the above is condensed to match the site's existing length.*

**Volunteer CTA:** "Apply to volunteer for Legacy Jam" — lives in its own
"Volunteer With Us" section right after "Why Legacy Jam," next to the media
pass request button. Links to `volunteer.html`, a built-in application form
that submits via FormSubmit to info@legacyjam.com (name, email, 19+, do you
drive, car access for the weekend, which volunteer roles — drivers,
tech/production, photography/videography, registration & check-in,
hospitality, setup & teardown, DJ/sound support — availability across Sat
Battle Day 12–7:30 PM, Sat after party 9 PM+, and Sun Workshops & Panels
10 AM–4:30 PM, plus a waiver & release of liability agreement).

**Media pass CTA:** "Request a Media Pass" — sits beside the volunteer button
in the same "Volunteer With Us" section, a plain `mailto:` link to
info@legacyjam.com with a short pre-filled body (name, outlet/handle, photo or
video, which day(s)).

**Generations Partner CTA:** "Become a Generations Partner" — links to
`generations-partner.html`, a built-in application form that submits via
FormSubmit to info@legacyjam.com (organization name, contact info, entering
the Generations Battle?, number of attendees, interested in optional
benefits?).

Confirmed Generations Partner logo, labelled with a small "Generations
Partners" title (`.partner-group`, matching the Funders/Academic
Partner/Media partners labels in the Partners & Funders section) right above
its own `.logo-row` below the CTA button: Now or Never Crew (links to
https://www.instagram.com/nowornevercrew/), 519 School of Hip Hop (logo
recoloured from its original white/light-grey outline art to dark navy, so
it reads against the white `.logo-row` card background), and The Heart (no
link provided). A second `.logo-row` right below
that stays `hidden` until the older, unconfirmed partners (BRKN Québec, The
Flava Factory, ABA, The Spot Arts Community, Breaking Canada, Tuff)
reconfirm for 2026.

## 7. Voice & style rules

- Simple words, short sentences. An excited 14-year-old and their parent should both get it.
- Lead with what the reader gets (prizes, experience), then details.
- "Breaking" (not "breakdancing"). "Cypher" spelled with a y.
- Always pair a claim with an action: every section ends in a link (tickets, register, follow).
- Accessibility first: real link text (never "click here"), alt text on every image,
  colour contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (the palette in `style.css` passes).
